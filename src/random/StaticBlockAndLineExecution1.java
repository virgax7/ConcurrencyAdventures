/*
    "The treatment of static fields with initializers (or fields whose value is initialized in a
    static initialization block [JPL 2.2.1 and 2.5.3]) is somewhat special and offers additional thread-safety
    guarantees. Static initializers are run by the JVM at class initialization time, after class loading
    but before the class is used by any thread. Because the JVM acquires a lock during initialization [JLS 12.4.2] and
    this lock is acquired by each thread at least once to ensure that the class has been loaded,
    memory writes made during static initialization are automatically visible to all threads. Thus statically
    initialized objects require no explicit synchronization either during construction or when being referenced.
    However, this applies only to the as-constructed stateâ€”if the object is mutable, synchronization is still
    required by both readers and writers to make subsequent modifications visible and to avoid data corruption"(Goetz 16.2.3)
