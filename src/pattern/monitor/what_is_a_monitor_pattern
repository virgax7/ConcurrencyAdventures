The bytecode instructions for entering and exiting a synchronized block are even called monitorenter and monitorexit,
and Java's built-in (intrinsic) locks are sometimes called monitor locks or monitors.
An object following the Java monitor pattern encapsulates all its mutable state and guards it with the object's own intrinsic lock. (Goetz Section 4.2.1)
